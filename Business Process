Business Process Model and Notation of colleague-tracker 

 

Before implementation 

The work culture changed into more working from home instead of always at the office. This makes it difficult to keep track of where everyone is working and if you can speak to them. The diagram below illustrates how the business process was before implementing the application. It consists of looking up a colleague on teams and sending them a message, without knowing if they were even working.

The main difference between the two diagrams is that the process is more streamlined in the second one. The employee will still need to search for the colleague, but they can easily see if the colleague they are looking for is working from home, the office, or is out on vacation. A simple press of the button will make sure the colleague is pinged and they can then respond.   

 

 

 

These are a simple picture of the business process in our group project. In these two diagrams, there is only one role which is the employee. After an employee takes one step there is no other person to intervene.
