# Introduction

In this document you will mainly find different development frameworks and comparison of some technologies which I did research before making choice on which to use. 




# API protocols, program language, and framework

In my group project I had the task of doing research on API protocol and framework we can use for the project. 
During the research, I read different articles and tutorials and made this document[ Research API Communication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vNq7vkWBH8nGBNXJI2bwtmQqz1PVfkcMMpw9jukkOkc/edit) for the team to decide on. 
Therefore, this made my life easier when making choices for my individual project. Although my team has chosen C# REST API for the group project, for me Java REST API with Spring boot was most interesting.


# Front-end development

In my individual project, I did a lot of research about frameworks to find which one is suitable for my project.
Since we were using react native in our group project, I did some research about react native and found that it wasn’t suited for my own project. 
I ended up choosing VueJS Javascript-based framework due to the fact that my project was small and VueJS was easier to learn from scratch compared to React Native. Moreover, it was easier to integrate with OAuth2 and with the backend APIs. 
From the official web page of [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/), I could generate a quick start project and start development.



# Back-end development

In my individual project, I am using Spring boot framework to develop and run my Java REST APIs.
I choose this framework because it is well documented and there are enough articles and tutorials for Java REST API with Spring boot like the popular [Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/) page. 
Moreover, spring boot was the best option for my application as my project was small. Here is the website where I generated the first playing ground project, [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).


 
# Database

Initially, I was thinking of using Oracle as a data store however, with the feedback I received from the teacher, I realized that it was suited mainly for the huge project. 
I decided to use the NoSQL database as MongoDb, I chose it because it supports various programming languages, and more importantly suitable for my use case as my project was storing and retrieving documents which MongoDb does better. 
It integrates well with popular development environments and provides official drivers for many programming languages. For more information on [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).
