**What is the Agile methodology?**

The Agile methodology is a way to manage a project by breaking it up into several phases. It involves constant collaboration with stakeholders and continuous improvement at every stage. Once the work begins, teams cycle through planning, executing, and evaluating. Continuous collaboration is vital, both with team members and project stakeholders.

**Scrum master**

In our group project, we work in an agile way where we use the scrum framework to deliver our work. To succeed as a team, one person is our scrum master. However, that person can be replaced by each sprint if necessary.

**Scrum event**

As a team we work in sprints, each sprint last three weeks. Before the start of the sprint, we do sprint planning to achieve our goals. We create a list of backlogs and then write user stories and after that, we do product backlog refinement with our product owner. Every Monday we have our stand-up to see our progress toward our goals. After those three weeks, we have a sprint review, where we present our accomplishments to the product owner.

One of the tools we used in our group project was Jira
